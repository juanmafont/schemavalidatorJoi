Based on this -> https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-joi-for-node-api-schema-validation  (only Joi version < 15.00)
and this -> https://jasonwatmore.com/post/2020/07/22/nodejs-express-api-request-schema-validation-with-joi  (updated to new Joi version, but one using different call)
